Small elements are put together by their standard streams, i.e., the
output of one process is used as the input of another process. To chain
processes like this, so-called anonymous pipes are used.

Generally there are two kinds of pipes: * anonymous pipes and * named
pipes

Anonymous pipes exist solely within processes and are usually in
combination with forks.
