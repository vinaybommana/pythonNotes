## Face Recognition: From Traditional to Deep Learning Methods

* Traditional Methods relied on hand-crafted features such as
  * edges
  * texture descriptors

  combined with machine learning techniques, such as
  * principal component analysis
  * linear discriminant analysis or
  * support vector machines
