- topological sorting of the dependency graph

* Bottom Up approach
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: bottom-up-approach
  :END:

- if we write the program bottom up, the function layout will match the
  logic flow - it'll go from the fully independent building blocks to
  the ones that depend on their results.

* top down approach
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: top-down-approach
  :END:

- for a top-down approach you'd flip the same structure on its head and
  start with the highest-level building block first, fleshing out the
  details later.

- vars -- function
- key sharing dictionaries
- ordered dicts are not only ordered but also very less size compared to
  2.7 dicts

- seperate chaining
- pprint -- very helpful for nested datastructures.
